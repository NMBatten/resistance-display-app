# Resistance Display

A mobile application written using REACT native that replaces the center board for a [game of resistance](https://indieboardsandcards.com/our-games/the-resistance/). This app tracks and displays the mission details and keeps track of the voting process while automatically checking for game end and mission fail conditions. Note: this only replaces the center board, all other pieces are still required.
